This is the Final Project for the Code in Place course from Stanford University. 

Scape from Troy is a text-based game, in which the player choses what will happen next. 

An initial text will be printed and the user will input their choice from two options. It basically uses inputs and if statements, and it is called "Escape from Troy". The goal is to help the Trojan hero Aeneas to escape from the city during greek invasion. However, the player might choose an option that will lead to the death of the character and will be forcer then to start over. The game ends when the player guides the hero out of the city alive.
